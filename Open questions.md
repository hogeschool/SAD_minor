# About assessment

Questions:

Can we get some standards for e.g. literature survery grading that we can refer to? For example, see Simon Peyton Jones's paper on how to write a proper paper.

lab journal + personal reflection + personal notebook

knowledge sharing (sufficient contribution in 3 of 4 weeks + external knowledge sharing requirements completed)

--> Studenten verplicht laten werken met Git
--> 10% afhankelijk van commented check-ins?
--> Daily checkins?

Have the literature survey be just a trawl through the literature, or have students write a paper on a cool idea that they have? Or a combi?

What to do which week --> link to learning goals & assessment

How the 25% knowledge sharing is constructed, e.g.:

--> 5% external knowledge sharing

--> 20% given when student has performed 3 out of 4 presentations with pass

curved grading within / between projects

Defining a 10 as the external client being "very happy" with the deliverable/report? (plus the minimal requirements for "complete" being completed of course)

Have the literature survey be I (individual) grade because this allows initial exploration into personal interest, allowing more interesting matches to be made in the group project? Have knowledge sharing, incl. lab journal, be a group thing because it is intrinsically connected to the group project?
