# MINOR / Security & advanced development

Name: Security & advanced development

*DdV*: Slopen die handel

Code: MINOR

Study load: 30 ECTS / 840 hours (only indicative, you may need background reading), made up of 144h contact, 620h homework, 10h revision, 2h exam, 2h check, 10h presentations, 10h planning, and 42h buffer.

Prerequisites: [to be decided], or permission of the instructor.

Format: Independent lectures (50 minutes "hoorcollege", only for full-time students ???, combined lecture for all classes in 5th floor college hall ???) and labs (100 minutes "werkcollege"), along with readings and other homework

Assessment: S (in week 5, retake week 9) and O (due week 8, corrections week 9). The exam is graded by two instructors as 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, with the average being the exam grade. The same counts for the presentation of the lab. Exam and lab grades are the average of the grades given by two graders, provided that they are within 2 points of each other. Otherwise, a third grader is consulted. The final grade is the average of the exam and presentation grade. Final grades are not rounded, and an average of 5.5 or higher is a pass, provided a minimum of 4 for the exam and presentation, and that all required assignments have been handed in on time.

Materials: Background readings are given in the course description. Note that some materials have to be read before the start of class.

Competences: As HBO-I 2014 states, security is a quality aspect that plays a role in all infrastructure layers and in all aspects of the development lifecycle. The focus is on the software and infrastructure layers. The exam seeks to bring students up to the relevant competences at level 2, and for certain aspects to level 3 where needed for the software engineer.

Objectives: After successfully completing the course, the student can: identify different conceptions of privacy and describe trends, determine with what methods privacy can be subverted, decide on appropriate methods for defending privacy, carry out a privacy impact assessment, apply privacy principles in practice within a self-chosen research topic.

Contents: Core ideas behind the course are empowering students with taking privacy back into their own hands, as well as understanding the trade-offs involved. The first half of the course consist of a theoretical overview of privacy, coupled with exercises. The second half of the course is a practical exploration of a privacy topic, chosen and worked on by a team of two students. Week 1 to 4 cover the questions, "What is privacy?", "How can privacy be subverted?", "How can privacy be defended?", and "What are contemporary privacy topics?". Week 5 to 8 consists of an investigation into a self-chosen topic.

Comments: Classes, homework exercises, exams, presentations, etcetera may be in English. Bring pen, paper, and laptop to all classes. Don't use your laptop unless asked. If class is cancelled due to holidays, exercises are to be made as homework.

## Week 03: Theory

## Week 04: Theory

## Week 05: Exam and planning

## Week 06: Project 1

During this quarter, 2.5 ECTS of theoretical material is studied, chosen by the student. This will be examined through an oral exam at the end of the quarter, after the project presentation. Grade for the theoretical material is either pass or fail. [Note: Can we make the Q&A session the oral exam? Can we directly give grades during the presentation, a la holding up cards during the presentation?]

## Exam

The exam consists of two parts: multiple choice and open questions. The multiple choice part consists of 20 multiple choice questions with 4 options of which a minimum of 14 need to be correct, for the exam to be admissible for grading. Related to each week from week 1 to 4 there will be 5 multiple choice questions related to the weekly learning objectives. The open questions are a case analysis of a privacy problem, and may require, among others, that the student analyses the situation from a privacy perspective, put the situation in a historical context, describe how privacy is being intruded, and make proposals for how it can be secured. The total time available for the exam is 100 minutes.

In the three cases that need to be analysed, these questions can act as a guide:

- [What does privacy mean in the given context?]

- [How can the privacy of individuals be harmed in this context?]

- [What methods are available for the protection of privacy?]

- [Are there recent developments in this topic? What is their impact on privacy?]

Handwritten notes (e.g. summaries of the readings, answers to the homework questions, notes from the activies), made by the student themselves, can be taken into the exam. Be at the exam room on time. The exam starts at the given time, sharp. Handwritten notes are allowed into the exam. When permitted during the exam, notes have to be handed in, and will not be returned.

Handwritten notes must be handed-written, and must have the format of unbound A4 paper that can be easily scanned. Notes will be scanned and shared with the other students, so do not label them with your name / student number if you feel uncomfortable with this. Exams with notes that do not conform to this standard will be regarded as not assessable. In the name of transparency and to make inspection of exams easier, graded exams will be distributed with all students. Only your student number is visible on the exams, but you can always opt-out of this service.

The open questions in the exam will be assessed based on the following metric as an indication:

2, very poor: Gross misconceptions, extremely unclear answers, no detail

4, fail: Serious misconceptions, answers sometimes unclear, some detail

6, pass: Minimal misconceoptions, clear answers, mostly adequate detail

8, very good: No misconceptions about important topics, completely clear answers, a lot of detail

10, excellent: As with 8, but going beyond topics covered in class and the homework, stunning depth of detail

Only students who have attended the exam have a right to sit the retake. In exceptional cases, as recognised by the exam board, the retake may be open to students with a valid reason for being unable to sit the exam. A retake for the exam is possible in week 10.

## Presentation

Grading for each presentation is based on the output as well as on the theoretical foundations. This is graded based a presentation on a report. Before the start of the project / subproject, it is up to the student to define the balance between application and theory. The application part of the project can consist of between 25% and 75% of the grade. The theory part can consist of between 75% and 25% of the grade. The presentation will take a maximum of 15 minutes, with 5 minutes of questions at the end. Presentations are graded as 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 by two instructors. The average of the two grades is the grade for the presentation. Note that concrete output is more important than a rainforest worth of documentation. The presentation will be graded using the metric below as an indication:

[Grading of theory part?]

2, very poor: A banal research question, no background research, no use of research methods, no reflection on findings, and a poor presentation.

4, fail: A very basic research question, only basic background research, relevant research methods not applied appropriately, weak reflection on results, and an unclear presentation.

6, pass: A clear research question, background research having at least the seminal articles, use of appropriate methodology for answering the research question, adequate reflection on results, and an understandable presentation.

8, very good: A creative research question, adequate background research, use of appropriate, use of multiple relevant methodologies for anwering the research question, thorough reflection with limitations and possible future work, and an engaging presentation.

10, excellent: A novel research question, thorough background research, use of innovative methods for answering the research question, (self-)critical reflection on the results including limitations, future work, and a critical evaluation of placing the findings within existing findings and critiquing these, and a stunning presentation.

[Grading of practical part? Include in the above list? Maybe not work with 25% to 75%, as this makes subjective interpretation very much quantified.]

Note: In the interpretation of results, no distinction is made between null results and between significant results, or between a system not being broken and one being broken. What will be graded is whether or not data has been produced, be that quantitative data or qualitative data.

A reparation for the presentation is possible within seven calendar days following the day of the presentation.
