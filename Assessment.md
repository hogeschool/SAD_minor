* 16:00 - 16:40 - Short pitches. What did you find, what was usefull, what was a problem, how did you solve it? What is still open? Combined with a Q&A with the lecturers AND your fellow students, you get the possibility to improve your presentation-skills *AND* the possibility to fix problems you have

## Exam

The exam taken at the first four weeks consists of 40 multiple-choice questions, created by you, your fellow students and the lecturers.

### Attendance

There is a full attendance requirement. In exceptional cases, attendance requirements can be waived.

### Pitching

Every mo-thu you and your partner will pitch on the subject, especially on the practical part of the day. What (un)usefull did you find? What came in handy? What problems did you occur, did you solve them, and if not: what are you going to do about it?

Every day you will get a grade for your pitch: "negative", "neutral" or "positive". You are able to raise and lower your final week-grade with one point.

### Grading

Every week you will have an individual multiple choice exam on Friday. The input of the pitches will be added to this regard. The final grade of the exams is the average of all exams, but only when **ALL** weeks are at least graded 4 or higher. Cesure of your final mark is 5.5.

Grades per multiple-choice exam are determined as: 10 - [1 point per 3 questions incorrect]. This integrates guessing chance.

### Failure

You didn't succeed the first time? No issue, you are able to redo your exam, but only withing one week of getting the result, and only for one week out of four. Also, an additional task needs to be delivered: you need to add an abstract (min-max 5 A4) from one or more academic papers.

## Week 5

In this week a retake of one multiple choice exam is possible. --> when? Friday?

Students write a plan for the project, do background research, etcetera for the project. This is worth 10%? of the grade.

Personal learning goals?

2.5ECTS --> theorie

5 ECTS --> praktijk

7.5 ECTS --> globaal aftoetsen in Q2

10% --> eigen theorie leerdoelen, achtergrondonderzoek --> week 5
10% --> individueel mondeling
20% --> eindrapport is theorie toetsing

Q1
7.5 theorie --> 4x multiplechoice op vrijdag

Q2
2.5 theorie
5.0 praktijk --> 4x 10% pitches

Q3
2.5 theorie
5.0 praktijk --> 4x 10% pitches

Q4
2.5 theorie
5.0 praktijk --> 4x 10% pitches

hangt theorie aan het project? of appart getoetst?



- wanneer inleveren ==> in week 9 of in week 10? wanneer nagekeken? wanneer retake?
- hoe met rest van 60%
- hoe 10% beoordelen --> true/false? --> slecht:0% / ok:5% / goed:10% + mogelijkheid om vrijdagmiddag/avond extra werk te verrichten bij twijfel
==> wel belangrijk om af te spreken wat studenten de week erop moeten opleveren
- hoe theorie aftoetsen ==> 30% van cijfer

## Week 6 - 9

Each week on Friday one pitch / presentation. Counts for 10% of the grade of Q2. In total this is 40% of the grade of Q2.

Where retakes are possible, these are only possible within one week of getting the relevant pass/fail grade of the exam/exercise. [Retakes have one grade point deducted per day, after the first day, that they are handed in after the original retake day. (Originals also?) For exercises that are late, hand-in is possible, but these are considered to be submitted for the retake.]

spend week 5, week 10, and week 15 on theory as preparation for the project? e.g. go through the recommended background reading quickly in the 10:30 to 12:00 hours? this can be combined with an in-class Q&A session to support students in their search for relevant background literature, hopefully also allowing them to learn from one-another

### Part 1

In Week 1 to Week 4, there are four multiple-choice exams, each worth 25% of the grade for Part 1 of the course. These exams are given on Friday at 15:00 - 16:40. A retake for one multiple

week 11 to 20: like week 5 to week 10 but then for Q3 and Q4

### Total grade

The total grade is the average of Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4, provided all are >= 4.0. A pass is a total of >= 5.5. No rounding is done before determining the pass grade. The final grade is rounded to one grade after the dot.

### Language

All materials and submitted exercises will be in English. In exceptional circumstances this rule may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis, given grave reasons.

### Link to ROM

7.5 ECTS of part 1 are theory

3x7.5 ECTS of parts 2/3/4 are 2.5 ECTS theory and 5 ECTS practice. Both are combined into one grade, with theory contributing 30% to the grade and practice 70%.
