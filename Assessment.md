# Assessment

This document must be merged into the other documents. It is mainly a braindump from the photo's taken at 18th of June 2015, and the 23rd of June 2015. It needs serious cleaning :P

## Planning

The first four weeks consist of the following topics:

- Cryptography
- Computer security
- Network security
- Humanoid security

Week 5 is an in-between week.

Week 6 to 9 is the core of Project 1.

Week 10 is an in-between week.

Week 11 to 14 is the core of Project 2.

Week 15 is an in-between week.

Week 16 to 19 is the core of Project 3.

Week 20 is a wrap-up week.

### Days in Week 1 to Week 4

Monday to Thursday the days will have the following program:

* [on the first monday: 9:00 kick-off, introduction of minor / first quarter]
* 10:10 - Lecturers are in, coffee available, possibility to ask questions
* 10:30 - 11:00 - Lectures start. Not in = too late.
* 11:00 - 11:20 - Students are creating exam-questions and answers for the exam at Friday.
* 11:20 - 11:30 - Coffee and optional nicotine
* 11:30 - 12:00 - Second round of lecture, combined with answering questions of students while creating exam-questions
* 12:00 - 12:10 - Time to round up the day
* 12:10 - 16:00 - Practice / work on hands-on exercises ?
* 16:00 - 16:40 - Short pitches. What did you find, what was usefull, what was a problem, how did you solve it? What is still open? Combined with a Q&A with the lecturers AND your fellow students, you get the possibility to improve your presentation-skills *AND* the possibility to fix problems you have

Friday:

* [08:30 to 10:10 as time for retake multiple choice, or do this on monday? --> Monday might be handier as it matches well with the kick-off, making scheduling easier]
* 10:10 - Lecturers are in, coffee available, possibility to ask questions

* 12:00 - 12:10 - Time to round up the day
* 12:10 - 15:00 - Practice / exam prep ?
* 15:00 - 16:40 - Exam. This exam consists of questions created by you, your fellow students and the lecturers.

### Days in Week 5 to Week 20 ???

??????

### Attendance

There is a full, 100%, attendance requirement. In exceptional cases, attendance requirements can be waived. [If your hamster dies, then man up and get your ass to school.]

### Pitching

Every mo-thu you and your partner will pitch on the subject, especially on the practical part of the day. What (un)usefull did you find? What came in handy? What problems did you occur, did you solve them, and if not: what are you going to do about it? --> [Do we want to make this a group discussion? / "groepsverhoor"?]

Every day you will get a grade for your pitch: "negative", "neutral" or "positive". You are able to raise and lower your final week-grade with one point. [Do we want to keep track of this, or just note down that performance in these pitches will either contribute positively or negatively on the choice between 0%/5%/10% if there is doubt between the three?]

### Grading

Every week you will have an individual multiple choice exam on Friday. The input of the pitches will be added to this regard. The final grade of the exams is the average of all exams, but only when **ALL** weeks are at least graded 4 or higher. Cesure of your final mark is 5.5.

Grades per multiple-choice exam are determined as: 10 - [1 point per 3 questions incorrect]. This integrates guessing chance.

[Do we want to add a requirement of students having attempted all exercises of that week?]

### Failure

You didn't succeed the first time? No issue, you are able to redo your exam, but only withing one week of getting the result, [and only for one week out of four --> probably we can't do this according to the OER]. Also, an additional task needs to be delivered: you need to add an abstract (min-max 5 A4) from one or more academic papers.

In any situations where a retake or reparation is given an additional taks needs to b edelivered: you need to write an abstract of one or more academic papers, which will be shared with other students to enable shared learning.

Students write a plan for the project, do background research, etcetera for the project. This is worth 10%? of the grade.

10% --> eigen theorie leerdoelen, achtergrondonderzoek --> week 5
10% --> individueel mondeling
20% --> eindrapport is theorie toetsing

- wanneer inleveren ==> in week 9 of in week 10? wanneer nagekeken? wanneer retake?
- hoe met rest van 60%
- hoe 10% beoordelen --> true/false? --> slecht:0% / ok:5% / goed:10% + mogelijkheid om vrijdagmiddag/avond extra werk te verrichten bij twijfel
==> wel belangrijk om af te spreken wat studenten de week erop moeten opleveren
- hoe theorie aftoetsen ==> 30% van cijfer

## Week 6 - 9

Each week on Friday one pitch / presentation. Counts for 10% of the grade of Q2. In total this is 40% of the grade of Q2.

Where retakes are possible, these are only possible within one week of getting the relevant pass/fail grade of the exam/exercise. [Retakes have one grade point deducted per day, after the first day, that they are handed in after the original retake day. (Originals also?) For exercises that are late, hand-in is possible, but these are considered to be submitted for the retake.]

spend week 5, week 10, and week 15 on theory as preparation for the project? e.g. go through the recommended background reading quickly in the 10:30 to 12:00 hours? this can be combined with an in-class Q&A session to support students in their search for relevant background literature, hopefully also allowing them to learn from one-another

### Part 1

In Week 1 to Week 4, there are four multiple-choice exams, each worth 25% of the grade for Part 1 of the course. These exams are given on Friday at 15:00 - 16:40. [A retake for one multiple-choice exam is possible in Week 5 on Friday at 15:00 - 16:40. / A retake for each multiple-choice exam is possible the week after on Monday at 08:30 - 10:10.] The multiple-choice exams each have 40 questions, in each of which one option out of four is correct. The grade for each exam is 10 - [1 point per 3 wrong answers]. This integrates a correction for guessing. The exam taken in the first four weeks consists of 40 multiple-choice questions, created by you, your fellow students and the lecturers.

### Part 2

In Week 5, on Friday at 09:00 sharp, a paper describing the theoretical framework, background research, and project plan for Project 1 is due. It is 10% of the grade for Part 2. Note that project teams can be up to two people in size. Exceptions only with clear reasons and with permission of the instructor. Additionally, a list of the personal learning objectives of the student is due at 09:00. It is part of the 10% of the grade of Part 2 that consists of active engagement in the personal learning process. The research paper is graded based on XXX. A pass/fail grade is determined the same day. In case of a fail, the student is given until the next [Monday / Friday] at 09:00 sharp to submit a repaired version. In case of a pass, a more fine-grained grade of 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 is [hopefully] determined within a week, together with [detailed] feedback.

In Week 6 to Week 8, short presentations of the project status are done between 15:00 and 16:40. Each presentation is worth 10% of the grade of Part 2. The result is given as 0%, 5%, or 10%. A 10% means that all agreed-upon deliverables and work has been completed and is at an acceptable quality. A 0% means that what is presented is severly lacking. A 5% means that the work is only partly adequate. This determination is made by two lecturers. When in doubt, the lower grade is given. A reparation is possible until midnight of the same day, at [24:00?] sharp, and should be handed in as a recorded video, of an appropriate lenth, and in a designated format. If they are used, slides are due before the start of the pitches in PDF format at the designated location.

+ hand in an update of theory status

week 9:
fri start of day: pitch of project status, 10% of grade Q2, grade as 0%/5%/10%, reparations for a couple of hours if result not clearly determinable
fri before pitches: project report, 30% of grade Q2, graded as fail (1) or pass (6) on day of hand-in, with 6/7/8/9/10 determined in the week after
fri after pitches: teaching other students through an exercise, 5% of grade Q2
fri before pitches?: reflection on personal development (together with active participation/learning throughout the quarter), 5% of grade Q2?
5% of grade internal knowledge sharing

+ hand in an update of theory status

week 10:
mon: if pass given week before, then project results to be shared externally in a responsible manner (ethical considerations, licensing, clarity, quality, etc), 5% of grade Q2
fri: handing in corrections to project report if fail is given, retake of these 30% of grade Q2
--> need to specify when external sharing of results needs to be done, and having report in the morning on friday and the external sharing at e.g. 18:00 if pass/fail is given by 12:00

+ Friday at 09:00 --> reflection report having personal learning objectives, weekly updates, and a closing reflection

### Part 3

The deliverables and grading of Part 3 are the same as part 2, i.e. week 10 - 15 correspond to the deliverables and grades in week 5 - 10. Part 3 contributes for 25% to the final grade.

### Part 4

The deliverables and grading of Part 4 are the same as part 2, i.e. week 15 - 20 correspond to the deliverables and grades in week 5 - 10. Part 4 contributes for 25% to the final grade.

### Curved Grading

For part 2,3 and 4, the assessment of the report will be done using 'Curved Grading'.

The initial grade ('pass'/'fail') will be done according:

* The report must be written in flawless English
* The report must be written according to the template of Guiseppe //FIXME
* The report must be written using academic papers, with the use of references
* The report must contain a research-question, and the report must sketch the theoretical background
* The report must contain a todo-list for the practical part of the project
* Generally, good papers consist of x pages //FIXME

### Total grade

The total grade is the average of Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4, provided all are >= 4.0. A pass is a total of >= 5.5. No rounding is done before determining the pass grade. The final grade is rounded to one grade after the dot. Retakes from the perspective of a fail are arranged as retakes or reparations of all individual grades. This means that the student gets a second chance for all components. In case of a failure for the minor, the complete minor can be retaken in its entirety the year after, but without necessarily having a right to attend class.

### Language

All materials and submitted exercises must be in English. In exceptional circumstances this rule may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis, given grave reasons. Classes and communication with lecturers is also expected to be in English.

### Link to the ROM

Part 1 consists of 7.5 ECTS of theory. Parts 2, 3, and 4 each consist of 7.5 ECTS of theory and practice combined. In the latter parts, 30% of the grade is derived from a theoretical framework and 70% from a practical framework. Together this corresponds to roughly 15 ECTS related to theory and 15 ECTS related to practice, equivalent to the guidelines in the ROM.
