# Assessement (mean everything >= 5.5)

FIXME:

- Decide on dates / times
- How and when to grade 10% individual learning --> project diary + oral
+ Combining grades and minima (e.g. minimal pass on individual grade)
- How and when to grade 25% knowledge transfer
- Focus of all the weekly recaps
- Going for scrum or waterfall
- Add summative assessments? --> probably too complicated
- Hoeveelheid van multiple choice vragen wellicht aanpassen? --> 10?
- Open vragen of prakticum in real time? 10 MC + 2 open? What about 25/week?

- What to do which week --> link to learning goals & assessment
- How the 25% knowledge sharing is constructed, e.g.:
  - 5% external knowledge sharing
  - 20% given when student has performed 3 out of 4 presentations with pass

- Have incomplete (I) and complete (C) instead of pass/fail for pedagogical reasons?
- Have more than one chance to fix "incomplete" projects? (Requiring students to complete an additional exercise / foot work each time?) (Wouldn't count for theoretical aspects / situations where exams need to be sat.)
- Make an incomplete at 0?

- Have absolute grading for less than XX students? (e.g. 20), because there might be insufficient variability in the grades of the student / too high a likelihood of excessively smart/stupid students? What about using grading on a curve with student number >= 30?
- How about grading on a curve not just within the technical track and the human track, but actually grading them together? This should lead to some healthy competetion :)

- Defining a 10 as the external client being "very happy" with the deliverable/report? (plus the minimal requirements for "complete" being completed of course)
