# Assessement (mean everything >= 5.5)

FIXME:

- Decide on dates / times
- How and when to grade 10% individual learning --> project diary + oral
+ Combining grades and minima (e.g. minimal pass on individual grade)
- How and when to grade 25% knowledge transfer
- Focus of all the weekly recaps
- Going for scrum or waterfall
- Add summative assessments? --> probably too complicated
- Hoeveelheid van multiple choice vragen wellicht aanpassen? --> 10?
- Open vragen of prakticum in real time? 10 MC + 2 open?

- What to do which week --> link to learning goals & assessment
- How the 25% knowledge sharing is constructed, e.g.:
  - 5% external knowledge sharing
  - 20% given when student has performed 3 out of 4 presentations with pass
