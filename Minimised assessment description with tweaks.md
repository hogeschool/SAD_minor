# Assessment

overal 55% is a pass, retakes take the form of retakes of individual parts of the programme

Have the literature survey be I (individual) grade because this allows initial exploration into personal interest, allowing more interesting matches to be made in the group project? Have knowledge sharing, incl. lab journal, be a group thing because it is intrinsically connected to the group project?

Parts that contribute 5% can be retaken/repaired within 3 calendar days, parts that contribute 10% can be retaken/repaired within 7 calendar days. An additional exercise will need to be completed to be allowed to take part in a retake.

Exam or deadline of assignment on Friday at 15:00 of the given week. Retake or deadline of reparation on Monday at 08:30 of the following week. At the instructor's discretion grade balancing and/or relative (e.g. curved) grading [and/or partial grades ???] may be applied.

[Option 1: A total minimum of 55% must be scored. Individual parts in part 1 need to be scored 2/5%, and in parts 2 to 4 they need to be scored 3/5% & 6/10%.] [Option 2: A total minimum of 60% must be scored. Individual parts need to be scored 3/5% or 6/10%.]

Can we get some standards for e.g. literature survery grading that we can refer to? For example, see Simon Peyton Jones's paper on how to write a proper paper.
