Learning goals (formal methods):
The student can
  read and understand a given formal system (FS0)
  set up a basic formal system with given properties (FS1)
  give convincing evidence that the properties of a formal system hold (FS2)
  

Examples of FS0, which is tested during the first week, are:
- encoding of Peano numbers and their recursively defined operations
- encoding of binary numbers and their recursively defined operations
- inductive definition of lists and their recursively defined operations
- inductive definition of trees and their recursively defined operations
- inductive definition of expressions in a programming language and their recursively defined operations
- inductive definition of statements in a programming language and their recursively defined operations

Examples of FS1, which are also all project topics, are:
- build a (scripting) programming language which prevents "null reference" errors through static typing
- build a (scripting) programming language which prevents sending unencrypted content
- build a (scripting) programming language which automatically generates a correctly working CMS

Examples of FS2, which are all handed-in as part the documentation in strict connection with FS1, are:
- tests
- analytical discussion
- formal proofs
