	\textbf{Learning objectives:} &
	In the context of security, the student can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item formulate strategies to adequately evaluate security \texttt{SEC1}
		\item dissect and construct the layers and objects of security \texttt{SEC2}
		\item apply and engage in the red vs blue team method either in the context of implementing/configuring or in the context of sketching/architecting \texttt{SEC3}
		\item apply and engage in the white box/laboratory study method either in the context of a code review or in the context of a user study \texttt{SEC4}
		\item apply and engage in the black box/field study method either in the context of a \textit{pentest} or in the context of a phishing campaign \texttt{SEC5}
	\end{itemize}

	In the context of formal methods, the student can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item determine abstract complex properties \texttt{FM1}
		\item encode these complex properties into languages, tools, and other libraries \texttt{FM2}
		\item dissect the layers and objects of languages, tools, and other libraries \texttt{FM3}
		\item architect languages, tools, and other libraries in a formal specification \texttt{FM4}
		\item build languages, tools, and other libraries within a functional, logic, or declarative programming language \texttt{FM5}
	\end{itemize} \\
