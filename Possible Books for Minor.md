# *Possible* books

## Q1 - Introduction

### Cryptography --> Cryptanalysis?


Extremely likely:
Exercises: Matasano

Somewhat likely:
Exercises: MT3

### Computer security --> ...?

### Network security --> Penetration testing?

### The human factor --> ...?

Quite likely:
David Lacey book?

Security management book?

## Q2 - "Blue Team, Red Team"

### Human Track

#### Threat modeling 

#### Security Architecture

*Guys in Delft are asked to deliver input* (Last update: 13/6/2015)

Engineering security?

Response from Adam Shostack when asked for a partner book to Threat Modeling:
I do not have any security architecture books i'm fond of. I think that most of them get the levelling or patterns wrong. I do like the van Duyne "design of sites" book, which has only a small security section. That may be a better pattern--embedding security architecture into the larger architectures of which it's a part. (I'm not deeply sure of that.)

Further response from Adam Shostack:

"Would love to hear what you think of that, I hadn't seen it. [Talking about Securing Systems book]

I think that creating something new is hard for students, there's a
useful opportunity to create threat models for real systems and get
feedback from the people who are building those systems."

### Technical Track

#### Security Operations

How to setup a secure environment


*Gerrit?*

#### Arne needs to seek his A4's

//TODO

## Q3 - White box evaluation / Controlled environment: in the lab / Lab work

Assessment of security

### Human track: Usable Security Test


Most likely:
Rocket surgery made easy

Not too likely:
Usable security book O'Reilly?

Feedback from Anne van Brussel:

Anne: Voor software developers die zelf usability tests willen uitvoeren is Rocket surgery made easy” by Krug het meest geschikt.
Arne: Thanks. Zo’n idee had ik ook. Toen ik het las klonk het wel als een beetje kort door de bocht hier en daar, maar als 1e boek is het waarschijnlijk de beste.
Anne: Dat klopt, Krug brengt het een beetje quick en dirty. Maar wel toegankelijk. Voor beginners en voor praktische toepassingen zeker geschikt.

### Technical track: Open Source Software Assessment

Most likely:

## Q4 - Black box evaluation / Open environment: in the field / Field work

### Human track: Phishing

Not sure:

Most likely:
Social engineering book Hadnagy?

Most likely:
Social engineering IT security

### Technical track: Penetration testing

Quite likely:
Book: Network security assessment?

Extremely likely:
Book: Web application hackers' handbook?

When asking Stefan:
That sounds interesting. However, I  have no good pen testing books to propose... I still believe that "hands-on" and CTF are best trainings...


Asking Stefan (Stefan.Lueders@cern.ch):

ARNE

Currently we’re working on setting up a Security Lab minor (half a year of courses). One of the three project will be a black box security evaluation. For this we’re looking at giving the students the option of doing the CERN WhiteHat Challenge. This would be the third of three projects, before which the students are given an intensive 4 week introduction into all the security aspects.

At the moment I’m looking for relevant reading materials. Do you have any favourite books related to (network) security evaluation that you would recommend for students?

STEFAN

That sounds interesting. However, I  have no good pen testing books to propose... I still believe that "hands-on" and CTF are best trainings...

ARNE

That’s certainly the plan :)  In the first project we will most likely have teams of students play a war game, with some Raspberry Pi’s on an offline network, with teams both playing the red and blue sides.

For the second project, we’re looking a having the students do a code audit of open source applications. Background reading for student who will want to know more will most likely be The Art of Software Security Assessment: Identifying and Preventing Software Vulnerabilities (http://www.amazon.com/The-Software-Security-Assessment-Vulnerabilities/dp/0321444426). Some preliminary ideas for students who want to do some background reading on pentesting are: Network Security Assessment (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034490.do) and the Web Application Hacker’s Handbook (http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118026470.html).

Regarding CTFs: in the beginning these may be at too high a level for students, so we’re still looking for an interesting collection of hands-on exercises for computer security, network security, and security management. For cryptography we’ll most likely go with the Matasano Crypto Challenges (http://cryptopals.com), so students get to break things like RSA and improper implementations of AES :)
