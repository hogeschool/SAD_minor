*Guys in Delft are asked to deliver input* (Last update: 13/6/2015)

Engineering security?

Response from Adam Shostack when asked for a partner book to Threat Modeling:
I do not have any security architecture books i'm fond of. I think that most of them get the levelling or patterns wrong. I do like the van Duyne "design of sites" book, which has only a small security section. That may be a better pattern--embedding security architecture into the larger architectures of which it's a part. (I'm not deeply sure of that.)
